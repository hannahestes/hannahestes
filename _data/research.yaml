    abstract-less: On a software team, a software product manager is the bridge between customers and software engineers. They seek to understand the customers' needs and work with the software team to deliver solutions. Thus, collaboration between software engineers and software product managers is important. However, effective collaboration can break down in the presence of mismatched expectations. To clarify software engineers' expectations and identify potential 
    abstract-more: misalignment between software product managers and software engineers, we designed and deployed a survey targeting software professionals that asks about the questions product managers should answer. We received 278 questions from 40 software product managers and 33 software engineers representing 21 companies. We classified the set of questions revealing topics surrounding the <i>logistics, product</i>, and <i>users.</i> Our results reveal that software engineers more often want to ask software product managers about users' characteristics and user <i>feedback</i> about the product. Our discussion includes details on problematic experiences that have arisen when working with software product managers, demonstrating that the misunderstanding of the <i>product</i>, <i>customers</i>, <i>market</i>, and <i>technical feasibility</i> of designs can lead to frustration. Through this work, we identify what software engineers want to ask software product managers, how that aligns with questions software product managers answer, and outline future research directions in this space.

    abstract-less: Software product managers have become critical to a software product’s success. They act as a liaison among various stakeholders - software engineers, management, and customers - to ensure a product meets customer needs. Despite the role’s rise in popularity, research and related educational materials are just emerging. In this paper, we aim to understand the educational needs of software product managers, and why embedding them in a software
    abstract-more: team is valuable. To do this, we collected survey responses from 59 software product managers and 63 software engineers, with responses from at least 24 companies, to identify the topics, skills, and abilities that software product managers find important for the role and the value they provide to software teams. Our results reveal that a software product manager’s value stems from their ability to provide the team with direction and a plan, give context for decision-making, and effectively communicate across stakeholders. To support this, someone new to the role must have competencies in technical and non-technical areas. A software product manager must excel at interpersonal communication, understanding the technical atmosphere, and deriving product sense from a vision and strategy. This paper provides the groundwork for future software product management curricula by identifying 21 key competencies and 10 factors to describe the role’s value in software teams.
